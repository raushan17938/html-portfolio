<h1>The Best Movies According to Raushan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtT_6HCj8MU">3 Idiots</a></h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. 3 IDIOTS follows college best friends, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), who drive down to Shimla in search for Rancho (Aamir Khan), their long-lost buddy. During their journey, they recall the times they shared together, the mischief they got up to, and all that they learned from Rancho.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSaQoVOFS1U">The Black Hole</a></h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie.Within the black hole, the Cygnus completely breaks apart. The drifting Reinhardt and Maximilian merge together above a burning, hellish landscape populated by dark-robed spectres resembling Cygnus drones. Meanwhile, the probe ship is led through a cathedral-like arched crystal tunnel by a floating, angelic figure.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIQ5hrfermg">Hera Pheri</a></h3>
<p>The plot revolves around two tenants, Raju and Shyam and a landlord Baburao Ganpatrao Apte , in desperate need of money, chance upon a ransom call via a cross connection. They hatch a plan to claim the ransom for themselves.
